# Project 3

## Project 3a

This project extends upon project 2's work with the UCI Heart Disease dataset. I apply and optimize a decision tree, MLP, and K-means clustering model with and without PCA. I analyze each model's performance given speed and accuracy metrics and discuss the pros/cons of each model.

## Project 3b

This project uses a dataset of weather data for binary classification for the presence of rain tomorrow. I preprocess the dataset and augment new features using domain knowledge. Then, I perform 5-fold CV on hyperparameter sets for SVM, logistic regresson, and a decision tree. I analyze various error metrics of the estimators, concluding that a logistic regression performs best by f1 score.
