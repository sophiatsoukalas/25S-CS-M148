# Project 1

## Notebook Description

This project contains a tutorial on visualizations, feature augmentation, and sklearn pipelines for large datasets. I analyzed a dataset of Airbnbs in NYC with the target of listing price given features like neighborhood and number of reviews. I augmented features like distance of the listing to the airport and created a pipeline to perform imputation and scaling on the dataet. Finally, I fit a linear regression model on the training data and analyzed RMSE metrics to interpret the performance of the model.

## Providing Context

Because this was my first assignment for the class (and also my introduction to sklearn), the methods used are improved upon in subsequent projects. I hope this repository can show my progress in familiarizing myself with standard ML/DS practices.
